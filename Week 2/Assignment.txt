Autograder Django Tutorial 01
Assignment instructions: https://www.dj4e.com/assn/dj4e_install.md . This assignment will cover the material in Part 1 of the Django tutorial at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/ but since we are doing the installation on PythonAnywhere you will need to go back and forth between the Django tutorial and our instructions to finish the assignment.

To receive a grade for this assignment, include this string 3d460f2a on the pages of your application.

If you need to run this grading program on an application that is running on your laptop or desktop computer with a URL like http://localhost... you will need to install and use the NGrok or LocalTunnel application to get a temporary Internet-accessible URL that can be used with this application. Make sure to use Django's port 8000 and not port 8888 as is used in the above documentation.

Here is a sample of what you might put into your views.py.

    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. 3d460f2a is the polls index.")

Also you will need to edit the file mysite/mysite/settings.py and change the following line:

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
