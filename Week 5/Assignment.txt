Instructions

Create a table in the database called "Ages":

CREATE TABLE Ages ( 
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  name VARCHAR(128), 
  age INTEGER
);

Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only these rows with the following commands:

DELETE FROM Ages;
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Rebeka', 38);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Juliette', 31);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Brannan', 36);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Samanthalee', 37);
Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:
SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X;

Find the first row in the resulting record set and enter the long string that looks like 53656C696E613333.

If you are using the SQLite command line interface, you can use the ".quit" command to exit the program.

Note: This assignment must be done using SQLite - in particular, the SELECT query above will not work in any other database. So you cannot use MySQL or Oracle for this assignment.
